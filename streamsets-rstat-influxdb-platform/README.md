# streamsets-rstat-influxdb-platform

A platform stack (generated by platys) with StreamSets Data Hub Platform (Cloud), RStudio, Minio S3, InfluxDB 2 and Grafana.

This has been generated using the [platys](http://github.com/trivadispf/platys) with the [platys-modern-data-platform](https://github.com/TrivadisPF/platys-modern-data-platform) stack. 

For easy provisioning, use [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) as documented [here](Lightsail.md). You need to have the Streamsets Data Hub deployment-id and deployment-token ready, before provisioning the platform.

When the platform is running, navigate to <http://$PUBLIC_IP> (replace $PUBLIC_IP with the public IP of the docker host) to find the documentation page of the platform offering a list of services and Web UIs, which are available.
