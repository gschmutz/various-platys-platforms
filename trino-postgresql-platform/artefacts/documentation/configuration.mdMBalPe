# `modern-data-platform` - Configuration v1.17.0

This is the documentation of the configuration settings which can be overwritten using a custom YAML file. All the defaults are defined in [`../modern-data-platform-stack/generator-config/vars/config.yml`](../modern-data-platform-stack/generator-config/vars/config.yml).

## Overall Settings

There are some overall settings which will control the behaviour for all or a group of services. These are listed in the table below.

| Config                                         	| Default 	| Since 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                        	                    	|

| `use_timezone`                             	|  	| 1.5.0 | The timezone to use for the whole stack. By default is empty so the timezone of the docker engine is not changed and it will run as `Etc/UTC`. If you want to set it to another timezone, then specify a Unix timezone string, such as `Europe/Zurich` or `America/New_York`. An overview on the valid timezones can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones> |  
| `private_docker_repository_name`                             	| `trivadis` 	| 1.5.0 | Docker images not available on public Docker Hub will be retrieved using this private repository. By default it points to `trivadis` and you have to login first, before you can use the generated stack, if you have selected a private image. Use this config to point to your own private docker registry if needed. |  
| `uid`                             	| `1000` 	| 1.9.0 | The UID to use when using the "user" property in a service to override the user inside the container. |  
| `env`           | ${PLATYS_ENV} 	| 1.16.0 | Optional environment identifier of this platys instance, by default take it from the environment variable (can be specified in the `.env` file), but can be changed to hardcoded value. Allowed values (taken from [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io/docs/graphql/enums/#fabrictype)): `dev`, `test`, `qa`, `uat`, `ei`, `pre`, `non_prod`, `prod`, `corp` |  
| `data_centers`                             	| `dc1,dc2` 	| 1.14.0 | A comma-separated list of data-center names, to use if the property `data_center_to_use` has a value != 0. |  
| `data_center_to_use`                             	| `0` 	| 1.14.0 | The data-center to use, if multiple DC should be simulated for a Kafka setup. |  
| `copy_cookbook_data_folder`                             	| `true` 	| 1.14.0 | Copy all the `data` folders of the various cookbook recipes into the `data-transfer/cookbook-data` folder. |  

## External Services

There are some overall settings which will control the behaviour for all or a group of services. These are listed in the table below.

You have to configure two environment variables, `PLATYS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` with the access key and `PLATYS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the access secret. This can be done on the on the docker host or in the `.env` file in the platform home (same folder where the `docker-compose.yml` is located). |

## Platform Services

The configuration settings for enabling/disabling a given service are named `XXXXX_enable` where XXXXX is the name of the service (he used to be named `XXXXX_enabled` in version 1.0.0).
For each service there might be some other settings, such as controlling the number of nodes to start the service with, whether the service should map a data volume into the container or controlling some other proprietary configuration properties of the service itself.
