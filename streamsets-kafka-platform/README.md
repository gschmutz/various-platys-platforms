# streamsets-kafka-platform
A platform stack (generated by platys) with StreamSets, Kafka and the Custom Dev Simulator plugin for StreamSets.

This has been generated using the [platys](http://github.com/trivadispf/platys) with the [platys-modern-data-platform](https://github.com/TrivadisPF/platys-modern-data-platform) stack. 

For easy provisioning, use [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) as documented [here](Lightsail.md).

When the platform is running, navigate to <http://$PUBLIC_IP> (replace $PUBLIC_IP with the public IP of the docker host) to find the documentation page of the platform offering a list of services and Web UIs, which are available.
